Integrate MyblogU free content with your Wordpress blog.

== Description ==

MyBlogU is the free blogging community that lets you crowd source your content idea and even content creation: Ask MyBlogU users to brainstorm a great idea and even provide blurbs (=partially write your content for you) and create better content easier (=better writing productivity!)

Here’s a quick case study of how MyBlogU increases blogging productivity: http://linkd.in/1Arir5l

This Wordpress plugin is meant to integrate any Wordpress.org blog with myblogu.com. It makes a few MBU tasks and features easier:

* Easier add and verify your blog
* Easier manage your brainstorm requests (create, close, etc)
* Review and / or approve all ideas that are being sent to you right from within your Wordpress dashboard
* Get notified when someone is inviting you to participate in their projects (= Build authority and citations by participating in other users’ projects!)

After the plugin is installed and activated, you’ll have two options:

* Login to your existing MyBlogU account (if you have one)
* Register a new MyBlogU account (your current blog will be auto-added and verified!). The only thing that you’ll need to do offsite is to verify your email address by clicking a verification link in the email that will be sent to you.
